			<h1>Fishing Skills</h1>
		</div>
		<p>There are multiple ways to catch fish but the most popular is casting. Anyone with a rod and reel can cast near or on any body of water. Boats are not needed for this method. The other method is trolling. This method uses a down rigger on a boat to sink lures beneath the surface to attact fish while the boat is moving.</p>

			<h3>Trolling Method</h3>
			<p> The trolling method is used on a fishing boat. The people fishing on the boat still use rods and reels to do this method. The way that they do this is they sink their line below the surface with a cannonball type weight so the bait that they are using in near the bottom of the body of water they are in. They do this because the fish hang  out near the bottom of sandy lakes. This is a useful method of catching walleye in Lake Erie.</p>

			<h3>Casting Method</h3>
			<p> The casting method used any rod and reel to simply throw a lure to a distance and then the fisher reels the lure back in. This is a kind of throw and retrieve method. This is method is popular because anyone can cast their rod into the water and it doesn't require a boat.</p>

			<h3>Carolina Rig</h3>
			<p> One of my favorite ways to rig my lure to my line is with the carolina rig method. I use this rigging for multipurpose fishing. This includes stationary fishing and drift fishing. For stationary fishing I use corn as my bait and let the hook sink to the bottom. This is the way that I catch huge carp. For drift fishing I use a floating jig for my lure and put a rubber worm on it. This keeps the lure off the bottom. This is how I fish for walleye in rivers.</p>
